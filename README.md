# assignement1javascript

I am attempting here to show that I have followed the instructions for assignmetn "Moment 3" in a Javascript-course that I am doing currently..

This is just an example. I have previous experience with Github before so this is just a short text.

Here's a command to copy my repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SaraM47/assignement1javascript.git
