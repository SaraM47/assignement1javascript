# GitHub Repository for Version Control Demonstration
This repository was created to demonstrate using GitHub for version control in a web service. This task aims to create a GitHub account, a public repository, and a README.md file that describes the task.

## Task Description
### Part 2.1 - Create a GitHub Account and Repository
1. Create a GitHub account or use an existing one.
3. Create a new public repository on GitHub that includes a README.md file.
3. Use markdown formatting to Describe the task and project in the README.md file.
   
### Part 2.2 - Create a Personal README for Your Profile
* Create a new repository with the same name as your GitHub username.
* Add a personal README.md file that will be displayed when someone visits your profile.
* Include information about yourself, your interests, skills, and any links to social media or portfolios.

Through this assignment of "Moment 3", I have gained practical experience in using GitHub for version control and managing repositories. I learned how to create a repository, add a README file, and use markdown to format documentation. Additionally, I understood the importance of creating a personal README for showcasing skills and interests on a GitHub profile, which can enhance professional visibility. I have done a little bit of repository when I read the course " Web Technology 1", but this is the first time I have done a README file.
